		<h1>COMMERCE BOARDING by <a href="http://www.ipcommerce.com">IP COMMERCE</a></h1>
		<hr />
		<p>
			Commerce Boarding offers easy connectivity to several external services to help qualify and assess the risk of your customers.  
			As you design your application and determine which services to consume, IP Commerce will provide you with a list of required 
			data elements to send to the IP Commerce Platform.
		</p>

		<p>
			This sample application will use the 'base' qualification configuration with the addition of Identity Verification. 
			The actual application fields you will need to send to the IP Commerce platform vary based on specific workflow.
		</p>

		<p>
			For additional information on the service and test credentials for the sandbox, checkout <a href="www.ipcommerce.com/boarding/default.aspx">www.ipcommerce.com/boarding/default.aspx</a>
